/*
 * @defgroup TransportLayerCore Transport Layer - Core Components
 *
 * The HTTP transport layer provides lower-level support for interacting
 * with standard HTTP/1.1 web servers. In particular those that are used
 * to host cloud-based services such as the Google Cloud Platform. Much if
 * not all of it can be used for other HTTP servers and uses. In fact, the
 * Google APIs Client Library for C++ uses it in the OAuth 2.0 module for
 * messaging with OAuth 2.0 servers.
 *
 * The HTTP transport layer is designed as a keystone building block to
 * implement the Google APIs Client Library for C++. One aspect of this is
 * that it does not explicitly dictate a particular implementation for the
 * physical HTTP messaging. Instead it chiefly provides an abstraction for
 * messaging and a means for "plugging in" implementation details for the
 * physical messaging. To be useful, it provides a reasonable implementation
 * suitable for most purposes. However some clients or situations may wish
 * to use some other mechanism, especially pre-existing ones in their
 * runtime environments. This is accomodated by the HttpTransport class.
 *
 * In addiition to the HttpTransport class, the core HTTP transport layer
 * also includes the HttpRequest, HttpRequestState and HttpResponse and
 * httpTransportErrorHandler classes. It also includes an abstract
 * AuthorizationCredential class for making authorized requests.
 * The Google APIs Client Library for C++ builds on this abstract class
 * to provide OAuth 2.0 support in the OAuth2 2.0 module. Together
 * this allows the transport layer to be used to comply with OAuth 2.0
 * protected resources without actually depending on a specific client-side
 * implementation of OAuth 2.0.

 * Abstract interface for creating concrete HttpTransport instances.

 *
 * This class implements a Factory pattern for instantiating new HttpTransport
 * instances. It acts as the base class for all HttpTransport factories used
 * by the Google APIs Client Library for C++ runtime library.
 *
 * It is recommended that you always use this class when defining classes and
 * interfaces rather than the concrete subclasses. If you need a factory but
 * do not care about the implementation, consider
 * HttpTransport::default_transport_factory().
 *
 * Current HttpTransport::default_transport_factory must be explicit set at
 * some point during execution (such as application startup).

   * This factory instance is independent of the default_transport_factory
   * in the config. If you want to use this instance as the default in the
   * config then call config->ResetDefaultTransportFactory with this instance
   * after the constructor returns.
